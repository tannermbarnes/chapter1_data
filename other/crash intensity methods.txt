How we calculated crash intensity:

We first normalized the population surveys or counts of Myotis bats in each site to between 0, 1 using the equation (normalized count = ((count minimum count) / (maximum count - minimum count)) at each site. Therefore, the maximum count of bats at each site will be 1 and the minimum count will be 0. Next, we used this equation (changen = countn â€“ countn-1) to calculate population crash intensity from one survey to the next. We did not divide the equation by the number of years between surveys because most sites were missing greater than 5 years between surveys and it was artificially lowering our crash results, and we know from the literature that Myotis population crashes usually happen 1 year after introduction of WNS (CITE). We then calculated the largest crash intensity survey to survey and took that number as the crash intensity caused by WNS for the site.
